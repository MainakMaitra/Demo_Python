Subject: SSG VOC – Introductory Discussion
Date: 17th July 2025
Attendees: Mainak Maitra, Amy Martinez, Mikki Ortega
Context: SSG VOC Discussion
(SSG = Specialist Services Group, VOC = Voice of Customer)

1. Background
A session was conducted with Mikkey’s team to discuss the level of effort and feasibility of obtaining more meaningful data for the SSG VOC.

The objective is to compare VOC survey results from two sources:

The survey completed after interaction with customer service.

The SSG-specific survey completed separately.

2. Discussion Points
Mikkey’s team showcased a dashboard published on a monthly basis.

The dashboard includes survey responses submitted by customers after service calls.

Customers are asked three questions, focused on:

Whether their problems were resolved.

Whether they would recommend Synchrony.

It was noted that 2342 customers responded to the SSG survey.

The dashboard data is being prepared by the Mario team.

The next step involves understanding the source data powering the Tableau dashboard.

The final goal is to create a comparison of the experience based on the surveys from a customer journey perspective to understand overall satisfaction.

3. Dashboard Metrics (Current Format of Publication)
The dashboard currently presents VOC data along the following dimensions, comparing VOC SSG and VOC CS across months from Jan’25 to Jun’25:

Customer Satisfaction

Problem Resolution

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

# Precision Drop Analysis: Key Insights from File Comparison

Based on the analysis output comparing the original and new files, here are the key insights:

## File Structure and Size Differences

1. **Missing UUID Column**: The NEW file is missing the UUID column that was present in the OG file, which impacts how calls can be grouped and analyzed.

2. **Row Count Difference**: The NEW file contains 4,474 rows, which is 1,597 more rows than the OG file (2,877 rows). This significant increase suggests either additional data was collected or the data representation changed.

3. **Date Column Type Change**: The Date column changed from object type in the OG file to datetime64[ns] in the NEW file, indicating a more structured date format.

## Precision Metrics Improvement

1. **Overall Precision Increase**: Precision improved from 0.7480 in the OG file to 0.7932 in the NEW file, representing a 6.05% increase. This means the model is more accurately identifying true complaints.

2. **True Positives & False Positives**:
   - True Positives increased from 2,152 to 3,549 (65% increase)
   - False Positives increased from 725 to 925 (28% increase)
   - The ratio of TP to FP improved significantly

3. **False Positive Rate Reduction**: The false positive rate decreased from 0.2520 to 0.2068, showing a meaningful improvement in reducing incorrect classifications.

## Category-Level Precision Changes

1. **Prosodica L1 Category Variations**:
   - Significant improvement in "fraud" category: +0.1410
   - Notable improvement in "credit bureau report": +0.2533
   - Some categories showed slight declines, such as "adverse action" (-0.0435)
   - "Dissatisfaction" category showed a major decline (-0.8914)

2. **Primary L1 Categories**:
   - All Primary L1 categories maintained perfect precision (1.0000) across both files
   - Sample count differences indicate more data available in the NEW file

## Data Distribution Analysis

1. **Customer & Agent Transcript**:
   - Both files have similar missing transcript rates (0.76% vs 0.49%)
   - Average transcript length remained consistent at around 2,465 characters for customers and 19,037 characters for agents

2. **Variable5 Analysis**:
   - Both files contain exactly 2,310 unique variable5 values
   - No variable5 values are exclusive to either file, suggesting consistent call identification

3. **Call Integrity**:
   - 1,077 variable5 values have different entry counts between files
   - This indicates that when UUID is removed, the same call may be represented differently

## Business Impact Insights

1. **Model Improvement**: The precision increase of 6.05% represents a significant improvement in complaint identification accuracy.

2. **Operational Efficiency**: The reduction in false positive rate from 0.2520 to 0.2068 means fewer resources spent on incorrectly identified complaints.

3. **Data Representation Change**: The increase in row count without adding new variable5 values suggests that the NEW file likely represents the same calls differently, possibly splitting calls into more granular segments.

4. **Category-Specific Opportunities**: 
   - Categories with improved precision (like "fraud" and "credit bureau report") demonstrate successful model refinement
   - The significant decline in "dissatisfaction" precision indicates an area needing further investigation

5. **UUID Removal Impact**: Without the UUID field in the NEW file, call-level grouping now relies solely on variable5, which may affect downstream analytics processes.

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Dissatisfaction Category**: The dramatic drop in precision for this category should be examined to understand what changed and how to address it.

2. **Evaluate Data Structure Change**: Understand why the row count increased significantly while maintaining the same number of unique variable5 values.

3. **Document UUID Dependency**: Update any systems or processes that relied on UUID for call-level grouping to use variable5 instead.

4. **Consider Category Rebalancing**: Some categories like "fraud" showed significant improvement while others declined, suggesting potential for targeted model adjustments.

5. **Validate Precision Improvements**: Conduct additional validation to ensure the precision improvements translate to better business outcomes across all important categories.

Subject: RE: Weekly Status Updates - Mainak Maitra (Week ending June 13th)
Hi Anil,
Hope you are doing well!
PFB the consolidated status of my progress for the week ending 13th June 2025.
1. Precision Drop Analysis - Enhanced Implementation:

Completed comprehensive root cause analysis framework implementing all project requirements
Delivered enhanced deep dive analysis addressing manager's feedback on negation patterns, agent contamination, and validation inconsistencies

2. Code Enhancements Delivered:

Primary Marker Logic Update: Implemented secondary validation override with FPâ†’TP corrections
Feature Engineering Enhancement: Added one-hot encoding for all complaint categories with ML-ready features

3. Key Insights Generated:

Negation Context Issue: Majority of false positives contain information-seeking vs complaint-driven negations
Agent Contamination Crisis: High percentage of false positives triggered by agent explanations with significant increase in key categories
December Inflection Point: Major precision drop in Dec 2024 established poor Q1 2025 baseline
Validation Breakdown: Problem categories show low rater agreement despite overall improvement

4. Solutions Delivered:

Context-aware negation detection rules separating complaint vs information patterns
Speaker-specific classification isolating customer complaints from agent explanations
Targeted validation retraining for problematic category-rater combinations
Conversation length-based confidence scoring addressing systematic misclassification

Thanks,
Mainak

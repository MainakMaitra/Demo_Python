What business logic or data transformation explains the increase from 2,877 to 4,474 rows while maintaining the same number of unique variable5 values (2,310)? Understanding if this represents more granular segmentation or a fundamental change in data structure.
For the 1,077 variable5 values that have different entry counts between files, what explains these differences? Some values show substantial increases (e.g., one variable5 going from 6 entries to 32 entries).
Has the fundamental definition or methodology for classifying "True Positive" or "False Positive" changed between these two datasets? The precision improvement from 0.7480 to 0.7932 (6.05%) needs validation against consistent evaluation criteria.
What factors contributed to the significant improvements in precision for categories like "fraud" (+0.1410) and "credit bureau report" (+0.2533)? Understanding these successes could inform strategies for other categories.
What data preprocessing or normalization steps were applied differently to the Date field, which changed from object type to datetime64[ns] format? This might impact time-based analyses and how historical data is interpreted.
Given that both files have nearly identical average transcript lengths (2,465 vs 2,465.50 for customer, 19,037 for agent), what explains the significant difference in the total number of rows? This suggests the content hasn't changed substantially but is being represented differently.

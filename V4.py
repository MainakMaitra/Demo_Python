Dear Team,

Hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out to understand the detailed process for claiming travel and expense (T&E) reimbursements related to the upcoming in-person training session on Storytelling Using Data in Hyderabad. Specifically, I would appreciate your guidance on the following points:

For daily meal expenses within the INR 2000 limit, is it mandatory to retain physical bills, or will scanned copies suffice for reimbursement?

If I use the Corporate T&E Card for Uber rides and upload soft copies of the invoices, will that be sufficient for claim processing?

I have installed the Emburse Enterprise app on my mobile. Is this the only platform available for creating and submitting expense reports?

Alternatively, if I email scanned copies of bills (hard or soft copy) to receipts@chromeriver.com, will an expense report be auto-created on my behalf?


Could you please also confirm the standard process for creating and submitting expense reports—platform to use, format of submission, and any relevant timelines or best practices to follow?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Mainak

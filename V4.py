Architecture-Driven Systematic Bias: 88.9% of problematic high-negation rules (8 out of 9) either maintain stable length discrimination or show worsening length-based bias, creating a systematic pattern where short informational queries are consistently misclassified as complaints while longer genuine complaints are correctly identified
Category-Specific Performance Degradation: Critical categories like Credit Card ATM (15 negation patterns), Billing Disputes (6-13 negation patterns), and Correspondence (6 patterns) all show STABLE to WORSENING length effects, meaning the precision drop concentrated in high-volume complaint categories where customers typically have brief informational interactions that get falsely flagged
Temporal Amplification Effect: The 44.4% of rules showing WORSENING length effects (compared to only 11.1% improving) indicates that the length-based discrimination problem intensified from Pre-period (Oct-Dec 2024) to Post-period (Jan-Mar 2025), directly explaining why precision dropped to 74.6% in February and only marginally recovered to 75.5% in March 2025

# Actionable Insights from Precision Drop Analysis

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Context-Insensitive Negation Handling** (96.7% of FPs)

**Action Items**:
- Implement universal negation template: `(query) AND NOT ((not|no|never) NEAR:3 (complain|complaint))`
- Add contextual negation detection for all complaint queries
- Test negation patterns across all existing rules
- **Expected Impact**: +15% precision improvement

### 2. **Agent Explanation Confusion** (58.5% of FPs)

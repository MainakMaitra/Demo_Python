1. Context-Insensitive Negation Handling
One-Liner: The system treats complaint-specific negations the same as informational negations, causing 92% of false positives to contain negation patterns without context awareness.
2. Agent Explanation Contamination
One-Liner: Agent explanations and hypothetical examples trigger false complaint detection, with 80% contamination rate causing precision to drop to 74.6% in February.
3. Qualifying Language Inversion
One-Liner: Real complaints use 4x more polite, uncertain language indicating genuine issue exploration, but the system penalizes politeness instead of recognizing it as a complaint signal.
4. Transcript Length Hidden Discriminator
One-Liner: True complaints are 71% longer because complex issues require detailed explanations, but the system ignores this strong discriminatory signal.
5. Validation Process Deterioration
One-Liner: Critical categories show 33-56% validator disagreement rates, creating noisy training data that teaches the system incorrect classification patterns.
6. ML Emotional Analysis
This analysis uses machine learning to understand which emotions in customer transcripts are strong signs of real complaints, and shows that in Jan–Mar 2025, emotions like politeness or 
frustration became harder to interpret — causing the model to confuse real and false complaints, which explains the drop in precision and points to the need for regular model updates and 
smarter language understanding.
